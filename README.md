FighterRobot
============

An AI robot that fights others in a simulated environment while adhering to game rules. The specifications of the robot and rules of the battle can be found in RobotWar.pdf. Note that avenues are columns and streets are rows, as defined in the becker library. 

<strong>The parent classes were not created by me and should not be modified. The only exception is the modification of the types and number of robots fighting (BattleManager.java, line 144-).</strong> The HashemFighterRobot is the primary fighter robot; the other robots exist to test the fighter robot against various strategies. To start the battle run the BattleManager.java file.

Files required:
- BattleManager.java
- FighterRobot.java
- OppData.java
- PlayerStats.java
- TurnRequest.java
- HashemFighterRobot.java
- HashemOppData.java

The becker library is also required. It can be downloaded here: http://www.learningwithrobots.com/software/downloads.html
